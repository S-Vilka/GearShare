      <h1>About GearShare</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to GearShare, your local platform for borrowing and sharing tools and equipment with your neighbors.
        Imagine this: your car battery dies, and you need a charger. Instead of purchasing one that might only be used
        once or twice a year, what if you could borrow one from a neighbor? GearShare makes this possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to foster a sense of community by allowing neighbors to share their resources easily and efficiently.
        Whether it's a tool, a piece of equipment that's rarely used, GearShare helps you find what
        you need without the hassle of awkward conversations or unnecessary purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform is simple. After registering, you can add items you're willing to share, browse available tools
        in your neighborhood, and reach out to the owner. By reducing the number of seldom-used items sitting in storage,
        GearShare encourages a more sustainable, connected way of living.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're currently focusing on the core features, building the foundation to make borrowing and lending as smooth
        as possible. Stay tuned as we continue to grow and add more features to enhance your GearShare experience.
